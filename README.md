scpyutils
=========
These are a collection of useful utilities that I have developed since I first started
using Python as my primary programming language in 2013. Over the years, I have refined
these utilities to be somewhat generic and useful for others but admittedly they are
still somewhat heavily customized for my own particular use cases.

Feel free to use at your own risk!

Note that even though this project has a `setup.py` file for easy `pip install .` usage,
the setup.py does not include all possible dependencies for all modules. For best
results, just copy paste the module into your own repo!

You can also install the repo directly as follows:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/sam-cohan/scpyutils.git#egg=scpyutils
```
