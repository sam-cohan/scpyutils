scpyutils
=========
These are a collection of useful utilities that I have developed since I first started
using Python as my primary programming language in 2013. Over the years, I have refined
these utilities to be somewhat generic and useful for others but admittedly they are
still somewhat heavily customized for my own particular use cases.

Feel free to use at your own risk!
